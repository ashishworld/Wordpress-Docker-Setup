# Build a Professional WordPress Development Environment with Docker in 5 Minutes

*Stop wrestling with XAMPP, WAMP, and Local by Flywheel. Create a consistent, portable WordPress development setup that works everywhere.*

---

## The Developer's Nightmare

Every WordPress developer knows this pain:

- **XAMPP crashes** after every Windows update
- **Different PHP versions** between your machine and production
- **"It works on my computer"** but breaks everywhere else
- **Hours wasted** setting up environments for each project
- **Plugin conflicts** with your local development stack

Sound familiar? There's a better way.

## The Solution: Docker-Powered WordPress Development

I'll show you how to build a Docker-based WordPress environment that eliminates these problems forever:

✅ **5-minute setup** for any new project  
✅ **Consistent environment** across all machines  
✅ **PHP 8.3** with optimized configuration  
✅ **Automated backups** and project management  
✅ **Production-ready** from day one

## What We're Building

Our Docker environment includes:

- **WordPress 6.4** with **PHP 8.3** (latest stable)
- **MySQL 8.0** database with external access
- **phpMyAdmin** for database management
- **Automated backup system**
- **Project management scripts**

## Docker Configuration Deep Dive

Here's the core `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  # MySQL Database
  db:
    image: mysql:8.0
    container_name: wordpress_db
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE: ${DB_NAME:-wordpress}
      MYSQL_USER: ${DB_USER:-wordpress}
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASSWORD:-wordpress123}
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${DB_ROOT_PASSWORD:-rootpassword123}
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
      - ./exports:/exports
    ports:
      - "${DB_PORT:-3306}:3306"
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "mysqladmin", "ping", "-h", "localhost"]
      timeout: 20s
      retries: 10

  # WordPress Application
  wordpress:
    image: wordpress:6.4-php8.3-apache
    container_name: wordpress_app
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "${WP_PORT:-8080}:80"
    environment:
      WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db:3306
      WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: ${DB_NAME:-wordpress}
      WORDPRESS_DB_USER: ${DB_USER:-wordpress}
      WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASSWORD:-wordpress123}
    volumes:
      - ./wordpress:/var/www/html
      - ./uploads.ini:/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/uploads.ini
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy

  # phpMyAdmin
  phpmyadmin:
    image: phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin:latest
    container_name: wordpress_phpmyadmin
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "${PMA_PORT:-8081}:80"
    environment:
      PMA_HOST: db
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${DB_ROOT_PASSWORD:-rootpassword123}
```

## Development Workflow

### Daily Development Process
```bash
# Start your development session
scripts\start.bat

# Develop your WordPress site
# - Install themes/plugins
# - Customize code
# - Test functionality

# Create regular backups
scripts\backup.bat

# Stop when done
scripts\stop.bat
```

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# .env file (customize per project)
DB_NAME=my_awesome_project
DB_PASSWORD=secure_password_123
WP_PORT=8080
WP_DEBUG=true
```

### PHP Optimization
```ini
# uploads.ini (pre-configured for performance)
file_uploads = On
memory_limit = 512M
upload_max_filesize = 128M
post_max_size = 128M
max_execution_time = 600
max_input_vars = 5000
```

## Why Docker Beats Traditional Tools

### Before Docker
- **Setup time**: 2-3 hours per project
- **Environment issues**: Weekly troubleshooting
- **Consistency**: "Works on my machine" syndrome
- **Updates**: Break everything regularly
- **Collaboration**: Different setups for each developer

### After Docker
- **Setup time**: 5 minutes
- **Environment issues**: Eliminated
- **Consistency**: Identical everywhere
- **Updates**: Controlled and predictable
- **Collaboration**: Same environment for everyone

### Time Savings Calculator
**Per project setup**: 3 hours saved  
**Monthly projects**: 5  
**Hourly rate**: $50  
**Monthly time savings**: $750+

## Advanced Features

### Automated Backup System
```bash
scripts\backup.bat
```
Creates timestamped backups with:
- Complete WordPress files
- Database dump
- Restore instructions
- Project metadata

### Health Monitoring
```bash
scripts\health-check.bat
```
Monitors:
- Container status
- WordPress accessibility
- Database connectivity
- Service performance

### Multi-Project Management
```bash
# Project A
DB_NAME=project_a
WP_PORT=8080

# Project B  
DB_NAME=project_b
WP_PORT=8090

# Project C
DB_NAME=project_c
WP_PORT=8100
```

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Quick Fixes

**WordPress not loading**
```bash
# Check Docker status
docker info

# View detailed logs
scripts\logs.bat

# Restart everything
docker-compose restart
```

**Database connection failed**
```bash
# Wait for MySQL startup (30-60 seconds)
# Check .env credentials
# Verify container health
docker-compose ps
```

**Port already in use**
```bash
# Change ports in .env file
WP_PORT=8090
PMA_PORT=8091
DB_PORT=3307
```
